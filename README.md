> A WordPress starter theme based on \_s.

This is a fork of the [underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) starter theme for WordPress. Underscores looked really promising but when I ran `npm install` almost everything was deprecated or broken. So I decided to fork the repo and personalise a new functional workflow based around `gulp` instead.
